      question: "What is Medicare?",
      answer:
        "Medicare is a digital hospital record management system that replaces paper-based hospital cards in Nigeria. It allows hospitals to securely store and manage patient data online.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who can use Medicare?",
      answer:
        "Hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers can use eMedCard. It supports different roles like admin, doctors, and pharmacists with separate dashboards for each.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is patient data secure?",
      answer:
        "Yes. All patient data is encrypted and stored securely in the cloud. Access is restricted to verified hospital staff with unique login credentials.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can multiple hospitals use Medicare?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Medicare is built as an enterprise solution, meaning each hospital gets its own secure workspace with separate data and staff management.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can doctors access patient history?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Each patient has a unique ID linked to their full health record, including allergies, contraindications, and previous visits.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Medicare include an AI assistant?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The AI module helps doctors make faster decisions by showing relevant history, checking for allergies, and alerting possible drug conflicts. It does not diagnose.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I print or download reports?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Doctors and admins can easily generate digital reports or print receipts directly from the system.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need internet-connected equipment?",
      answer:
        "For advanced integration (like automatic printing and equipment data transfer), internet-connected PCs and printers are required. However, basic record functions work with any modern browser.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Medicare free?",
      answer:
        "We offer a free trial for hospitals. Afterward, pricing depends on the number of staff accounts and storage needs. Contact our sales team for a quote.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started?",
      answer:
        "Simply sign up on our website as a hospital admin, add your staff, and start registering patients. Setup takes less than 10 minutes.",
